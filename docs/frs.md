# ðŸ§¾ Functional Requirements Specification â€“ Swag Labs

---

## 1. Project Overview

Swag Labs is a demo e-commerce web application designed to simulate user interactions such as login, product browsing, cart management, and checkout. It is primarily used for automation testing and QA workflow simulations.

---

## 2. Functional Scope

The system must support the following functionalities:

- Login with predefined credentials
- Product listing and filtering
- Add/remove products from the cart
- View cart contents
- Complete the checkout process
- Handle errors for blocked or problematic users

---

## 3. User Roles

- **Standard User**: Full access to all functionalities
- **Locked Out User**: Restricted access (login fails)
- **Problem User**: UI inconsistencies
- **Performance Glitch User**: Simulated slow response
- **Error User**: Simulated backend errors
- **Visual User**: Simulated visual bugs

---

## 4. Business Rules

- All users use the same password: `secret_sauce`
- Only valid usernames can access the system
- Cart contents must persist until checkout or logout
- Checkout requires an active user session
