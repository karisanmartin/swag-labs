# 🧪 Test Plan Swab-Lab Automation

Automated testing for the **Swab Lab** platform, developed as part of my professional transition into QA Engineering. This project includes functional and integration tests using **Playwright** and **TypeScript**, focused on validating key user flows and traceability.

I also applied a structured testing methodology called **CANDO-Test**. This modular framework provides a clear and scalable approach to designing and executing automated tests, especially for web applications.

## 🧩 CANDO-Test Automation Structure

This project follows the **CANDO-Test** methodology — a modular framework for structured UI test automation. It promotes clarity, reusability, and separation of concerns across all testing layers.

### 🔠 What CANDO-Test Stands For:

| Letter | Layer                 | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C**  | Components            | Reusable building blocks representing UI elements and their behavior.                                             |
| **A**  | Assessment            | Evaluation logic — test cases designed to assess system behavior under various scenarios.                         |
| **N**  | Network Emulation     | Tools and structures to simulate real-world network behavior and responses (formerly "Network Mocks").            |
| **D**  | Data Variant Creators | Utilities for generating diverse sets of test input data.                                                         |
| **O**  | Objects               | Page Object and Page Object Builder — abstractions representing pages and flows, encapsulating user interactions. |

## 📚 About CANDO-Test

The testing methodology used in this project is based on **CANDO-Test**, a modular framework for structured UI test automation. It emphasizes clarity, reusability, and separation of concerns across components, assessments, data variants, and page objects.

You can learn more about the CANDO-Test framework on [Max Martínez’s official article](https://maxmartinez.dev/introducing-cando-test-a-framework-for-structured-ui-test-automation).

## 🤝 Collaboration Note

This project was developed with the support of **Microsoft Copilot**, my AI companion throughout this QA journey. From organizing test plans to refining documentation and automation strategies, Copilot helped me stay focused, structured, and inspired. It's been a collaborative experience that reflects my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.
